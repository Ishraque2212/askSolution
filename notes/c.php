            <h2>Introduction to C Programming Language</h2>
            <!-- Your C programming notes content -->
            <p>
                C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the
                early 1970s.
                It is widely considered the mother of all programming languages and has been influential in the
                development of many other languages.
                C was designed to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to
                machine instructions, making it suitable for system programming and embedded systems.

            <h3>Key Features of C:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Procedural Language:</strong> C follows a procedural programming paradigm, emphasizing the
                    use of functions and structured programming techniques.</li>
                <li><strong>Portable and Efficient:</strong> C programs can run on various platforms with minimal
                    changes, and they are known for their efficiency and speed.</li>
                <li><strong>Rich Library Support:</strong> C provides a standard library that includes functions for
                    input/output, string manipulation, memory allocation, and other common tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>Pointers:</strong> C supports pointers, which are variables that store memory addresses.
                    Pointers are essential for dynamic memory allocation, array manipulation, and efficient data
                    structures.</li>
                <li><strong>Modularity:</strong> C supports modular programming, allowing developers to break down
                    programs into smaller, manageable functions or modules. This promotes code reuse and
                    maintainability.</li>
                <li><strong>Static Typing:</strong> C is a statically typed language, meaning that variable types are
                    determined at compile time. This helps catch errors early and optimize code execution.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Basic Syntax and Structure:</h3>
            <p>C programs consist of functions, which are blocks of code that perform specific tasks. Every C program
                must contain a <code>main()</code> function, which serves as the entry point of the program. Here's a
                basic example of a C program:</p>

            <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\\n");
    return 0;
}</code></pre>

            <h3>Data Types:</h3>
            <p>C supports various data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and user-defined
                types such as structures and unions. Data types determine the type of values that variables can store
                and the operations that can be performed on them.</p>

            <h3>Control Flow Statements:</h3>
            <p>C provides control flow statements such as <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>switch</code>,
                <code>while</code>, <code>do-while</code>, and <code>for</code> for making decisions and looping.</p>

            <h3>Functions:</h3>
            <p>Functions in C are blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They can accept parameters and return
                values. Functions allow for code reuse, abstraction, and modular programming.</p>

            <h3>Arrays and Pointers:</h3>
            <p>Arrays and pointers are fundamental concepts in C. Arrays allow for the storage of multiple values of the
                same data type, while pointers store memory addresses. Pointers are often used for array manipulation,
                dynamic memory allocation, and efficient data structures.</p>

            <h3>Memory Management:</h3>
            <p>C provides manual memory management through functions like <code>malloc()</code> and <code>free()</code>.
                While this gives programmers greater control over memory usage, it also introduces the risk of memory
                leaks and segmentation faults if not used correctly.</p>

            <h3>File Handling:</h3>
            <p>C supports file handling operations for reading from and writing to files. File handling functions allow
                programs to interact with files on the system, enabling tasks such as data storage, retrieval, and
                manipulation.</p>

            <h3>Advanced Topics:</h3>
            <p>Advanced topics in C include structures, unions, enumerations, function pointers, dynamic memory
                allocation, preprocessor directives, and bitwise operators. These features provide additional
                capabilities for building complex and efficient programs.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                In conclusion, C is a powerful and versatile programming language that continues to be widely used and
                influential.
                Its simplicity, efficiency, and close-to-hardware capabilities make it suitable for a wide range of
                applications, from system programming to high-performance computing.
                While C requires careful memory management and lacks some modern features found in higher-level
                languages, its strengths lie in its performance, flexibility, and direct control over hardware
                resources.
                Learning C provides a solid foundation in programming concepts and is essential for anyone pursuing a
                career in software development or computer science.
