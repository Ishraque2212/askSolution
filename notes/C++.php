    <h1>C++ Programming Language</h1>
    <div class="cpp-info">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language widely used for system programming,
            game development, high-performance applications, and more. It was developed as an extension
            of the C programming language and introduced additional features such as classes, inheritance,
            and polymorphism.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Object-Oriented:</strong> C++ supports object-oriented programming (OOP) principles,
            allowing developers to create classes, objects, and hierarchies to model real-world entities.
            This promotes code reusability, modularity, and maintainability.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Performance:</strong> C++ is known for its high performance and efficiency, making it
            suitable for applications that require low-level hardware interaction, memory management, and
            computational speed. It provides direct access to hardware resources and allows fine-grained
            control over system resources.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Portability:</strong> C++ code can be compiled and run on various platforms, including
            Windows, Linux, macOS, and embedded systems. Its standardization by organizations like the
            International Organization for Standardization (ISO) ensures language consistency across
            different compilers and environments.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Rich Standard Library:</strong> C++ Standard Library provides a comprehensive set of
            classes and functions for common tasks, such as input/output operations, containers, algorithms,
            and concurrency. It simplifies development by offering reusable components for a wide range of
            programming tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Memory Management:</strong> C++ allows manual memory management through features like
            pointers and dynamic memory allocation, giving developers precise control over memory usage.
            However, this flexibility also introduces the risk of memory leaks and segmentation faults,
            requiring careful memory management practices.
        </p>

        <h2>Core Concepts</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Syntax:</strong> C++ syntax is based on the C programming language, with additional
            features such as classes, templates, and namespaces. It follows a procedural programming
            paradigm while supporting object-oriented programming constructs.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Classes and Objects:</strong> C++ allows developers to define classes, which are
            user-defined data types encapsulating data and functions. Objects are instances of classes
            that can interact with each other through member functions and data members.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Inheritance and Polymorphism:</strong> C++ supports inheritance, allowing classes
            to inherit properties and behaviors from other classes. Polymorphism enables objects of
            different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class, facilitating code
            reuse and flexibility.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Exception Handling:</strong> C++ provides exception handling mechanisms to deal
            with runtime errors and exceptional situations gracefully. It allows developers to separate
            error-handling code from normal program logic, enhancing code readability and robustness.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Templates and Generic Programming:</strong> C++ templates enable generic programming,
            allowing developers to write flexible and reusable code that works with different data types.
            Template-based constructs such as function templates and class templates enhance code
            expressiveness and efficiency.
        </p>

        <h2>Advanced Topics</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>STL (Standard Template Library):</strong> The C++ Standard Template Library (STL)
            provides a collection of generic algorithms, containers, and iterators for common programming
            tasks. It includes data structures like vectors, lists, maps, and algorithms for sorting,
            searching, and manipulating data.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Concurrency and Parallelism:</strong> C++ offers support for multithreading and
            concurrent programming through features like threads, mutexes, condition variables, and
            atomic operations. This allows developers to write efficient and scalable concurrent
            applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization):</strong> RAII is an important
            idiom in C++ for managing resources such as memory, file handles, and locks. It ensures
            that resources are properly acquired and released by tying their lifetimes to the
            lifetimes of objects.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Smart Pointers:</strong> C++11 introduced smart pointers like unique_ptr,
            shared_ptr, and weak_ptr, which provide automatic memory management and help prevent
            memory leaks and dangling pointers. Smart pointers facilitate safer and more
            predictable memory handling.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language with a rich set of features
            and extensive capabilities. Its combination of high performance, low-level control,
            and abstraction mechanisms makes it suitable for a wide range of applications,
            from system programming and game development to scientific computing and
            embedded systems. By mastering C++ fundamentals and exploring its advanced
            features, developers can create efficient, reliable, and scalable software
            solutions that drive innovation and address complex challenges in the
            modern computing landscape.
