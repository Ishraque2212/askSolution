        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers
            to build server-side and networking applications. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O
            model, making it lightweight and efficient for handling concurrent connections and real-time
            data-intensive applications.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Asynchronous and Event-Driven:</strong> Node.js employs an asynchronous, event-driven
            architecture that enables non-blocking I/O operations. This allows Node.js to handle multiple
            connections simultaneously without blocking the execution of other tasks, resulting in high
            performance and scalability.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Single-Threaded:</strong> Node.js uses a single-threaded event loop to handle incoming
            requests and callbacks. While traditional server-side platforms create a new thread for each
            incoming request, Node.js can handle thousands of concurrent connections within a single thread,
            minimizing resource overhead and maximizing efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Rich Ecosystem:</strong> Node.js has a vibrant ecosystem of packages and modules
            available through the Node Package Manager (NPM). NPM provides access to thousands of libraries,
            frameworks, and tools that simplify development tasks, accelerate project delivery, and enhance
            application functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Scalability:</strong> Node.js is highly scalable and well-suited for building
            real-time, data-intensive applications that require handling a large number of concurrent
            connections. Its non-blocking, event-driven architecture allows developers to create
            horizontally scalable systems that can easily handle increasing loads by adding more
            computational resources.
        </p>

        <h2>Core Concepts</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Event Loop:</strong> The event loop is the heart of Node.js, responsible for handling
            asynchronous operations and I/O events. It continuously checks for pending tasks, executes
            callbacks when events occur, and delegates heavy computations to worker threads or the underlying
            operating system.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Modules and Packages:</strong> Node.js follows a modular approach, allowing developers
            to organize code into reusable modules. Modules encapsulate related functionality, while packages
            bundle multiple modules together for distribution via NPM. CommonJS is the module system used
            in Node.js, providing a simple way to define, import, and export modules.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Callback Pattern:</strong> Callbacks are a fundamental aspect of Node.js programming,
            used to handle asynchronous operations and I/O events. Callback functions are passed as arguments
            to asynchronous functions and invoked once the operation completes or an event occurs. While
            effective, callback-based code can lead to callback hell, a situation where nested callbacks
            become hard to manage.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Streams:</strong> Streams are a powerful feature in Node.js for handling large amounts
            of data efficiently. They provide an abstract interface for reading from or writing to a data
            source in a sequential manner, without loading the entire dataset into memory. Streams can be
            readable, writable, or both, enabling data manipulation and transformation in real time.
        </p>

        <h2>Advanced Topics</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Asynchronous Programming Patterns:</strong> In addition to callbacks, Node.js supports
            various asynchronous programming patterns such as Promises, async/await, and event emitters.
            Promises provide a cleaner alternative to callbacks for handling asynchronous operations, while
            async/await offers a more synchronous-like syntax for writing asynchronous code. Event emitters
            enable custom event-driven architectures for building modular and extensible applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Microservices Architecture:</strong> Node.js is well-suited for microservices architecture,
            where applications are composed of small, independent services that communicate via lightweight
            protocols like HTTP or message queues. Microservices allow for greater flexibility, scalability,
            and maintainability by decoupling functionality into discrete components that can be developed,
            deployed, and scaled independently.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Web Frameworks:</strong> Node.js has a variety of web frameworks and libraries that
            simplify the development of web applications and APIs. Express.js is one of the most popular
            Node.js web frameworks, providing a minimalist, flexible, and feature-rich environment for
            building web servers and APIs. Other frameworks like Koa, Hapi, and NestJS offer alternative
            approaches and feature sets for different use cases.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Node.js applications can benefit from various
            performance optimization techniques, including code profiling, caching, load balancing,
            and clusterization. Profiling tools like Node.js's built-in Inspector or third-party
            solutions can identify performance bottlenecks and optimize critical paths to improve
            application responsiveness and scalability.
        </p>
