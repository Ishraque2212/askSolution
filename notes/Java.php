    <h1>Java Programming Language</h1>
    <div class="java-info">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Java is a versatile, platform-independent programming language known for its simplicity, reliability,
            and wide range of applications. Developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) in
            the mid-1990s, Java has since become one of the most popular languages among developers worldwide.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Object-Oriented:</strong> Java is built on an object-oriented programming model, making it
            ideal for creating modular and reusable code. It supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism,
            facilitating the development of scalable and maintainable applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Platform-Independent:</strong> Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can be executed
            on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This "write once, run anywhere" capability allows
            Java applications to run seamlessly on diverse devices and operating systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Rich Standard Library:</strong> Java provides a comprehensive standard library, known as the
            Java Development Kit (JDK), offering a wide range of classes and packages for common tasks such as
            networking, file I/O, concurrency, and GUI development.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Automatic Memory Management:</strong> Java features automatic garbage collection, which
            simplifies memory management by automatically reclaiming unused memory. This helps prevent memory
            leaks and makes Java programs more robust and stable.
        </p>

        <h2>Core Concepts</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Java Syntax:</strong> Java syntax is similar to C/C++, making it easy for developers with
            experience in these languages to transition to Java. Key syntax elements include variables, data types,
            control structures (if-else, loops), methods, and classes.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</strong> Java's OOP paradigm revolves around classes and
            objects. Classes serve as blueprints for objects, encapsulating data and behavior, while objects are
            instances of classes that interact with each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Exception Handling:</strong> Java provides robust support for exception handling, allowing
            developers to gracefully handle errors and unexpected conditions in their code. This helps improve
            application reliability and fault tolerance.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Concurrency:</strong> Java offers built-in support for concurrent programming through
            multithreading and synchronization mechanisms. Developers can create multithreaded applications to
            leverage modern hardware capabilities and improve performance.
        </p>

        <h2>Advanced Topics</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Java Virtual Machine (JVM):</strong> The JVM is the runtime environment that executes Java
            bytecode. It provides various optimizations, including just-in-time (JIT) compilation, garbage
            collection, and memory management, to enhance application performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Enterprise Java (JEE):</strong> Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) extends Java's capabilities to
            support enterprise-level applications, including web services, distributed computing, and
            large-scale systems. JEE provides specifications and APIs for building robust, scalable, and
            secure enterprise solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>JavaFX:</strong> JavaFX is a platform for creating rich internet applications (RIAs) and
            desktop applications with a modern, user-friendly interface. It offers a comprehensive set of UI
            components, multimedia support, and animation capabilities for building engaging user experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Java Collections Framework:</strong> Java Collections Framework provides a set of interfaces
            and classes for representing and manipulating collections of objects. It includes data structures
            such as lists, sets, maps, and queues, along with algorithms for common operations like sorting and
            searching.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Java's versatility, platform independence, and robustness make it a top choice for developers worldwide.
            Its rich standard library, strong community support, and active development ensure that Java remains
            relevant and powerful in today's software landscape. Whether you're building enterprise applications,
            Android apps, web services, or games, Java provides the tools and capabilities needed to bring your
            ideas to life. By mastering Java fundamentals and exploring its advanced features, developers can
            create efficient, reliable, and scalable software solutions that drive innovation and empower
            businesses across industries.
