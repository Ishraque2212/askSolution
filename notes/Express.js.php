        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Express.js is a minimalist, flexible, and feature-rich web application framework for Node.js.
            It provides a robust set of features for building web servers and APIs, allowing developers
            to create scalable, efficient, and maintainable applications with ease.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Routing:</strong> Express.js offers a powerful routing system that allows developers
            to define routes for handling HTTP requests. Routes can be defined for different HTTP methods
            (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and URL patterns, making it easy to create RESTful APIs and
            define application endpoints.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Middleware:</strong> Middleware functions are at the core of Express.js, providing a
            flexible mechanism for handling requests and responses in a modular and composable manner.
            Middleware functions can perform tasks such as logging, authentication, input validation,
            error handling, and more, allowing developers to customize the request-handling pipeline
            according to their application's needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Template Engines:</strong> Express.js supports various template engines like EJS,
            Pug (formerly Jade), Handlebars, and Mustache for rendering dynamic content on the server.
            Template engines enable developers to generate HTML markup dynamically based on data from
            the server, facilitating the creation of dynamic web pages and views.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Error Handling:</strong> Express.js provides robust error handling mechanisms
            for managing errors that occur during request processing. Error-handling middleware can be
            used to centralize error handling logic, allowing developers to catch and handle errors
            gracefully without crashing the server or leaking sensitive information.
        </p>

        <h2>Core Concepts</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Application:</strong> The Express.js application object represents the Express
            application and provides methods for configuring routes, middleware, settings, and more.
            Developers create an instance of the Express application by calling the express() function.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Router:</strong> Routers are mini Express applications that can be used to group
            route handlers for a specific part of the application. They provide a modular way to organize
            route definitions and middleware, making it easier to manage complex applications with multiple
            endpoints and features.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Middleware:</strong> Middleware functions in Express.js are functions that have access
            to the request (req), response (res), and next (next) objects. They can modify the request and
            response objects, terminate the request-response cycle, or pass control to the next middleware
            function in the stack by calling the next() function.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Route Handlers:</strong> Route handlers are functions responsible for handling
            requests to specific routes. They take the form of middleware functions and are executed when
            the route is matched. Route handlers can perform tasks such as processing requests, querying
            databases, generating responses, and invoking additional middleware.
        </p>

        <h2>Advanced Topics</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>RESTful APIs:</strong> Express.js is commonly used for building RESTful APIs due to its
            simplicity and flexibility. Developers can define routes, middleware, and controllers to
            implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for interacting with resources over
            HTTP using standardized methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Authentication and Authorization:</strong> Express.js provides middleware and strategies
            for implementing authentication and authorization in web applications. Developers can use
            middleware like Passport.js to integrate various authentication strategies (e.g., username/password,
            OAuth, JWT) and enforce access control policies based on user roles and permissions.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>WebSockets:</strong> While primarily designed for handling HTTP requests, Express.js
            can also be used to implement WebSocket-based real-time communication in web applications.
            WebSocket libraries like Socket.io can be integrated with Express.js to enable bidirectional,
            event-driven communication between clients and servers, facilitating the development of
            interactive, collaborative applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Testing and Debugging:</strong> Testing and debugging are essential aspects of
            application development. Express.js applications can be tested using frameworks like Mocha,
            Chai, and Supertest, which provide tools for writing unit tests, integration tests, and
            end-to-end tests to ensure application correctness and reliability.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Express.js simplifies web development with Node.js by providing a minimalist yet powerful
            framework for building web servers, APIs, and web applications. Its rich set of features,
            robust middleware ecosystem, and flexible architecture make it a popular choice among
            developers for creating scalable, efficient, and maintainable applications. By mastering
            Express.js's core concepts, advanced features, and best practices, developers can leverage
            its full potential to create modern, responsive, and feature-rich web applications that
            meet the demands of today's dynamic web landscape.
